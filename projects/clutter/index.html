    <h1>What is Clutter?</h1>
    Clutter is a service where you make collections of Scratch projects that relate to themselves. This way, you could have a series
    of projects that link to the next part. Example:<br><br>
    part 1 -> part 2 -> part 3 -> part 4 <br>
    whereas without Clutter you have to use alternative means, such as linking the next part on the project page, in the project,
    creating a studio or hoping that the player happens to see your projects and find the next part.
