    <h1>What is Clutter?</h1>
    Clutter is a service where you make collections of Scratch projects that relate to themselves. This way, you could have a series
    of projects that link to the next part. Example:<br>
    part 1 -> part 2 -> part 3 -> part 4 <br>
    whereas without Clutter you have to use alternative means, such as linking the next part on the project page, in the project,
    creating a studio or hoping that the player happens to see your projects and find the next part.<br><br>

    You can create a Collection by using the button in the navigation bar. This will bring you to the Collection creation page,
    where you'll have to provide the following information:<br>
    <li>
      <ul>the name of the Collection</ul>
      <ul>the project IDs of the Collection</ul>
    </li>
    To create a Collection, you need at least 2 projects, and they need to be shared. Unshared projects aren't supported,
    and creating a Collection with 1 project is also unsupported.<br><br>

    Once you create your Collection, it is impossible to edit or delete it. <b>Once you create your Collection, it stays forever 
    in its original form</b>.
